# This is a workaround to a known problem:
#  To stream the last episode of a podcast, podget keeps getting
#  the new episodes, and deletes all but the newest. As this is
#  done by using the file modification date and som podcasters
#  don't set the modification dates properly on their files,
#  sometimes newer episodes are deleted and an old one keeps
#  streaming all the time because it has a bad modification date.
#  Setting this to true will make the scripts delete ALL the
#  podcasts every time, and redownload them again. This means
#  a lot of data transfer every time, so set this value 
#  wisely.
